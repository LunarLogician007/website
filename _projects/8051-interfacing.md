### Overview
- Configured **timers, interrupts**, and **SPI/UART** to interface peripherals like ADC, UART, LCDs, and sensors
- Developed **RSA encryption** and decryption from scratch using **8051 Assembly** and memory-mapped registers
- Wrote custom routines for **prime check, totient computation**, and **modular exponentiation** on hardware

*Detailed write-up coming soon.*
