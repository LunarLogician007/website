### Overview
- Designed a **16-bit** reduced instruction set CPU as a **Finite State Machine** model having 23 states using **Verilog**
- Developed **combinational logic** to execute 15 instructions including arithmetic, control flow, and memory R/W
- Created **Hardware Flowcharts** to achieve **minimal number of states** in the processor, enhancing efficiency
