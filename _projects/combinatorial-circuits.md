### Overview
- Designed digital circuits in **VHDL** using **Quartus**, including ALU, **BCD adder**, and **sequence detector**
- Built a Mealy Finite State Machine **FSM** for word detection in binary strings, tested using **Scan Chain** on **Xen10 board**
- Implemented a **Fibonacci sequence generator** and validated through simulation and FPGA testing
