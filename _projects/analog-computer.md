### Overview
- Built an **analog computer** to solve second-order differential equations using op-amp summing and dual integrator blocks
- Implemented **Howland current-source** integrators for improved stability, accuracy, and initial condition control
- Developed **Butterworth** and **Chebyshev filters** using **Sallen-Key topology** for noise reduction in circuit
- Characterized **MOSFETs**, and designed **common-source amplifiers** and **current mirrors** for analog processing
